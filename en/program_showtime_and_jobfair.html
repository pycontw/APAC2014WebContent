<p>This year, we are going to bring you perfect events for benefitting the relationship between participants and sponsors: <b>Sponsor Show Time</b> and <b>Job Fair</b>!</p>

<h2>What is it?</h2>
<h3>Sponsor Show Time</h3>
<p>Like a carnival, it is a party we encourage our sponsors to show their products, culture, and even what they can do for you! All you need to do is to walk around the booth area, take a look on what's going on there. We bet you will find something really impressing.</p>

<p>Hey, don't just look around! This event also encourages you to get involved and further socialized with our sponsors. You could exchange your name card, introduce yourself, and dig into their culture. This is definitely important because it will not only catch your eyes but also there is <i>Job Fair</i> coming right on next day.</p>

<h3>Job Fair</h3>
<p>After introducing the insight of those companies to you, Job Fair is the day we prepared for those looking for new opportunities, planning to cultivate new skills, or eager to work on gorgeous projects.</p>

<p>How about go through a face-to-face interview then?!</p>

<p>There are several tables just near the booth, so you and your interviewer an go through a deep communication from your career plan and what you wanna be. Don't hesitate to meet our sponsors, because we believe you can earn more from this.</p>
